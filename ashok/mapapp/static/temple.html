        Padaleeswarar Temple, located in Thirupathiripuliyur, Cuddalore, is a revered Hindu shrine dedicated to Lord Shiva, known here as Padaleeswarar, and his consort, Periya Nayagi (Parvati). With a history spanning over 2,000 years, the temple was constructed during the Pallava and Chola periods, showcasing the grandeur of Dravidian architecture. Its five-tiered Rajagopuram (gateway tower) and expansive prakarams (corridors) exemplify the architectural brilliance of the era. The temple is classified as a Gnazhar Koil, indicating that the presiding deity is enshrined under a Gnazhar tree, a feature highlighted in ancient Tamil Saiva literature.

This temple holds immense religious significance as one of the 275 Paadal Petra Sthalams, sanctified in the Tevaram hymns by the Nayanmar saints. It is notably associated with Saint Appar (Thirunavukkarasar), who, after being miraculously saved from persecution, embraced Shaivism at this very site. A local belief suggests that a single worship at Padaleeswarar Temple is equivalent to multiple visits to other prominent Shiva temples, underscoring its spiritual prominence.â€‹

Situated near the Thirupathiripuliyur Railway Station and Cuddalore Main Bus Stand, the temple is easily accessible to devotees and tourists alike. Its rich history, architectural splendor, and profound spiritual legacy make Padaleeswarar Temple a significant landmark in Tamil Nadu's religious and cultural landscape.
