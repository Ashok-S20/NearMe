        Saint David, known in Welsh as Dewi Sant, is the patron saint of Wales. Born around 500 AD in Pembrokeshire, Wales, he was a 6th-century bishop and missionary who played a pivotal role in spreading Christianity throughout the region. He founded a monastic community at Glyn Rhosyn (now St Davids), which became a significant center for Christian learning and pilgrimage. Renowned for his ascetic lifestyle, Saint David advocated for a simple life of prayer, study, and manual labor. He is also associated with several miracles, including restoring a blind man's sight and causing the ground to rise beneath him while preaching, allowing the crowd to see and hear him more clearly. Saint David passed away on March 1, 589 AD, a date now celebrated annually as Saint David's Day in Wales. He was canonized by Pope Callixtus II in 1120, and his legacy endures as a symbol of Welsh identity and spirituality.â€‹
